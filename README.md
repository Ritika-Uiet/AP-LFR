# AP-LFR: Patch-based Latent Fingerprint Recognition
A Novel Approach for Reliable Identification of Partial Prints

•	Augmentation of the samples using the classical approach and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

•	A patch size estimation algorithm is proposed for analyzing and deriving the minimum required partial sample size for efficient recognition.
